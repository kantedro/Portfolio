A list of things I find challenging: 
* I have not taken the time to learn properly how media queries work properly, so it's been always a struggle.
* The use of 'Section' over 'Div' which I find easier to use (Div)
* Resizing sometimes imgs, is it better to set width right when placing or better when working in your CSS? 
* % over PX I kind of understand it, but yet I struggle. 
* Procrastination (Note to myself: You can't do everything the night before the deadline, well, I could, but not if I go to bed at 9pm)

Few things that I feel I've improved:
* The use of "rem" over "px". Px it's still much easier to use for me, but I'm trying to use more rem.
* Tough isn't big of a deal, I'm glad that I'm getting better a targeting (a smol achievement for me lol)
* Grouping everything into Divs and commenting (didn't do much in this assignment tho)
* I promise I got better with grids (also, didn't do much in this assignment but I really have)
* Creating Navbars, compared to 1st semester, it's getting better. 
* I've played with VS lately, and I have learned more commands, as for now my favorite is (Alt+Shift+F)
